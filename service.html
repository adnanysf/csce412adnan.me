                    <p>I am currently a Peer Teacher at Texas A&M University. I assist in lab sessions and hold office hours for all 100 and 200 level computer science courses.

                    <p>I volunteer at my local mosque time to time during various events. These events can be anything from a local food drive to a Houston fair. Throughout high school, I was very active and attended a lot of events. However, 
                        ever since moving to College Station, I have not been able to help as consistently. A link to my local mosque can be found <a target="_blank" href="https://duusa.org/masjid/">here.</a> </p>
