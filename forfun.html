    <h1>What I Like to Do for Fun</h1>

    <div class="fbox">
        <p>I have always found immense joy in playing soccer, and it has been an integral part of my life since I can remember. The beautiful game's combination of strategy, teamwork, and individual skill has always captivated me. One of my greatest sources of inspiration in the world of soccer has undoubtedly been Lionel Messi. His unparalleled talent, incredible work ethic, and unwavering dedication to the sport have consistently pushed the boundaries of what is possible on the field. Watching Messi play has not only been a source of awe but also a reminder that with passion and persistence, one can achieve greatness. Whether I'm dribbling the ball on a dusty field or watching a Messi highlight reel, soccer remains a source of inspiration and joy that has enriched my life in countless ways.
             Here is a link to my favorite soccer team, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.fcbarcelona.com/en/">FC Barcelona</a>.

        <p>Movies have been my lifelong passion, an enchanting escape that I've cherished for as long as I can remember. The art of storytelling through film, whether as an audience member or a creator, has an indescribable allure. Watching movies offers a glimpse into different worlds, cultures, and emotions, allowing me to connect with characters and narratives on a profound level. Moreover, delving into the intricate process of making films, from scripting to shooting to post-production, has been an ongoing journey that I cherish. While my pursuit of a career in Computer Science is a pragmatic choice to secure my financial future, the dream of being involved in the world of cinema has never faded. It remains my lifelong aspiration, the beacon of creativity that I hope to follow once I've established myself in the tech industry. Movies, in all their forms, have a unique power to inspire, challenge, and transport us, and I am committed to being a part of that magic.
             Here is a link to my favorite movie, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8946378/">Knives Out</a>.
