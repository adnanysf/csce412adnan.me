                        I am currently pursuing a Bachelor of Arts in Computing with a concentration in Cybersecurity at Texas A&M University. I have an expected graduation date of Spring 2025, therefore I am currently seeking a Software Engineering internship role for Summer 2024. I have taken various courses that cover vital areas in software engineering such as Data Structures and Algorithms, Analysis of Algorithms, Embedded Systems Development, and much more. Throughout academia and personal work I’ve learned numerous languages such as Python, C/C++, JavaScript, Java, Swift, HTML and CSS. I’ve also learned a few technologies and frameworks through hackathons and personal projects such as React.js, Next.js, Express.js, MongoDB and Node.js.
                         Using these skills I was able to compete and win a game development competition using just Python. The competition was about a week long, and very team focused. 
                        Individually, I’ve also created a movie ranking app using the MERN stack, MongoDB, Express, React, and Node. This is still an ongoing project and more information about both of my personal projects can be found in the projects tab. I also work as a Peer Teacher at Texas A&M University, I assist the TA during lab sessions and hold office hours for all 100 and 200 level computer science courses. I’m also part of TAMUhack, an organization that is responsible for two hackathons at Texas A&M University. Throughout my time at this organization, I’ve learned many business, communication, and marketing skills. In the field of Software Engineering, I am particularly interested in Front-End development. I've always had a passion for design and I love creating design boards and implementing them in code. 
                        Although my interests lie within the realm of Front-End development, I also share a lot of interest in the backend side as well. I’ve always wanted experience in managing a large database, and I plan to somewhat gain that experience using the projects I’ve created.
