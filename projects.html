              <p>Chore Dash is a game developed in python and it is based around a character who has to finish their chores before their mom gets home.
                There are numerous activities the player can do including a minigame where the player has to battle dirty dishes. The game was developed by a
                 team of 4 and we were given a week to complete the game.
